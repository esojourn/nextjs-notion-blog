AI杀到音乐领域了。suno根据提示词要求，创作不同风格的音乐，2分钟出两首。
实测效果很惊艳，我在第一时间做了支持适配。

### 测试流程
1. 先让GPT生成歌词，起个歌名

2. 然后把风格“powerful dream pop”和歌词发给suno。
等两分钟后，成品如下：

3. 了解一下歌词的写作要求，发现还可以优化。
上面我写的歌词太长了。可以精简，每行字数一致会更好一些。
歌词可以按这个结构写，suno会按要求把握情绪和高潮

```
style:
chinese traditional folk,slow,Ethereal,angelic voice,zheng

lyrics:
昨夜雨疏风骤，
浓睡不消残酒。
试问卷帘人，
却道海棠依旧。
知否，知否？
应是绿肥红瘦。


常记溪亭日暮
沉醉不知归路
兴尽晚回舟
误入藕花深处
争渡 争渡
惊起一滩鸥鹭
```

### 2. What's wrong with my cat?

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Guys I don't know what is wrong with my cat
Why does he look like that?
What is wrong?
Please help!

[Verse]
Woke up this morning to a strange cat stare
What's wrong with my feline, he's got a funky hair
Eyes all wide and his tail's fluffed up high
Oh, I don't know what's wrong, it's got me asking why

[Chorus]
Paws and claws, oh my goodness, what's the cause?
My little kitty acting strange, I'm at a loss
Paws and claws, can't understand the meows
Someone please help, don't know what's wrong with him now

[Verse 2]
He's jumping up and down like he's playing in a game
But his fur's all scruffy and his eyes look so tame
Does he want some food or is he just feeling mad?
I hope he's okay, it's got me feeling so sad

[Verse]
Guys I don't know what is wrong with my cat
Why does he look like that?
What is wrong?
Please help!

[Verse 2]
He's jumping up and down like he's playing in a game
But his fur's all scruffy and his eyes look so tame
Does he want some food or is he just feeling mad?
I hope he's okay, it's got me feeling so sad

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Paws and claws, oh my goodness, what's the cause?
My little kitty acting strange, I'm at a loss
Paws and claws, can't understand the meows
```
